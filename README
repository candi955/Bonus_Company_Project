A C# programming project completed through my school.  It has been created as a GUI application with menu choices and various options 
to navigate employee bonus choices, a contact page, etc., for an imaginary company.  The code was written and GUI setup within the 
Visual Studio 2019 application.  It requires a few datasets for some of the pages to function, which were also created within Visual Studio.
